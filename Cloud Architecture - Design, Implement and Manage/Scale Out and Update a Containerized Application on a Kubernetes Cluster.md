## Cloud Architecture: Design, Implement, and Manage
### Scale Out and Update a Containerized Application on a Kubernetes Cluster

### Challenge scenario
You are taking over ownership of a test environment and have been given an updated version of a containerized test application to deploy. Your systems' architecture team has started adopting a containerized microservice architecture. You are responsible for managing the containerized test web applications. You will first deploy the initial version of a test application, called echo-app to a Kubernetes cluster called `echo-cluster` in a deployment called `echo-web`.

1. Before you get started, open the navigation menu and select **Cloud Storage**.

2. Verify the echo-web-v2.tar.gz file is in the `gs://[PROJECT_ID]` bucket.

3. Check to make sure your GKE cluster has been created before continuing.
4. Open the navigation menu and select **Kuberntes Engine > Clusters**.   
Continue when you see a green checkmark next to `echo-cluster`:

5. To deploy your first version of the application, run the following commands in Cloud Shell to get up and running:
```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials echo-cluster --zone=Placeholder value.
```
```
kubectl create deployment echo-web --image=gcr.io/qwiklabs-resources/echo-app:v1
```
```
kubectl expose deployment echo-web --type=LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8000
```
#### Your challenge
You need to update the running `echo-app` application in the `echo-web` deployment from the v1 to the v2 code you have been provided. You must also scale out the application to 2 instances (Qwiklab's typo: should be 2 **replicas**) and confirm that they are all running.

### Task 1. Build and deploy the updated application with a new tag
The updated sample application, including the Dockerfile and the application context files, are contained in an archive called `echo-web-v2.tar.gz`. The archive has been copied to a Cloud Storage bucket in your lab project called `gs://[PROJECT_ID]`. V2 of the application adds a version number to the output of the application.

Solution ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ 

1. Follow the instructions in the Challenge Scenario.

2. Set default compute region and zone in local client (Cloud Shell) to that for Kubernetes cluster.
In Cloud Shell,
```
gcloud config set compute/region [Region]
gcloud config set compute/zone [Zone]
```
To verify,
```
gcloud config get-value compute/region
gcloud config get-value compute/zone
```
Reference:  
[gcloud compute defaults](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute)

3. Download a copy of `echo-web-v2.tar.gz` from Cloud Storage bucket to Cloud Shell
```
gcloud storage cp --recursive gs://[Project_ID]/echo-web-v2.tar.gz . 
```

Reference:  
[gcloud storage](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/storage)  
[gcloud storage cp command](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/storage/cp)   

4. Unzip archive of application context files and Dockerfile into your current working directory
```
tar -xf  echo-web-v2.tar.gz 
```

5. Build the Docker image for version 2 (`v2`) of the `echo-web` application
```
docker build . --tag gcr.io/[Project_ID]/echo-app:v2
```
  - syntax: docker build . -t gcr.io/[Project_ID]/[Image Name]:[Tag]
  - the `.` in the command specifies that the PATH is the local directory
  - command must be executed from directory containing source code and Dockerfile

To verify, execute `docker images` to check for custom image and base image.

### Task 2. Push the image to the Container Registry
Your organization uses the Container Registry to host Docker images for deployments, and uses the `gcr.io` Container Registry hostname for all projects. You must push the updated image to the Container Registry before deploying it.

Solution ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

1. Push `v2`-taggged Docker image to gcr.io Container Registry
```
docker push gcr.io/[Project_ID]/echo-app:v2
```
To verify, in Cloud console > Container Registry > confirm that `echo-app:v2` container image has been uploaded

2. Update echo-web Kubernetes pods to use `echo-app:v2` image instead of `echo-app:v1` image
```
kubectl set image deployment/echo-web echo-app=echo-app:v2
```
- Syntax: kubectl set image deployment/[deployment name] [container/app]=[container/app]:[new tag]
- alternative approach is to edit deployment yaml `kubectl edit deployment/[deployment name]`

To verify, check rollout status for `v2` of echo-app `kubectl rollout status deployment/echo-web`, and/or get details of updated deployment with `kubectl get deployments`

3. Upsize (scale) Deployment to 2 Replicas
```
kubectl scale deployment/echo-web --replicas=2
```
To verify, `kubectl get deployments`

### Troubleshooting

**Receiving a 504, Gateway timeout error:** This might just indicate that the application hasn't quite initialized yet, but it could also be caused by a mismatch between the default port that is set in the Dockerfile (TCP port 8000) and:
- The choice of application port you configured when deploying the application image, or
- When you configured external access.
