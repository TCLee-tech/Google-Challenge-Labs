#### Provisioners  
Terraform use them to upload files, run shell scripts, install and trigger software, e.g. config management tools.  
https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/provisioners/syntax  
Most provisioners require access to remote resource via SSH, expect nested connection block with details on how to connect:

#### Terraform Modules  
https://www.terraform.io/language/modules   
Modules can be loaded from local filesystem or remote sources, e.g. Terraform Registry, version control systems, HTTP URLs, cloud storage buckets, Terraform Cloud, Terraform Enterprise private module registries.  
Modules from Terraform Registry: https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules  

#### Terraform state
Records relationship(bindings) between the cloud infrastructure objects and resource instances declared in configuration (.tf file).  
Default: Stores the Terraform state file (terraform.tfstate) locally in the current working directory.  
Recommended: Store remotely on a cloud server for team access.    
Backends: Where Terraform's state snapshots are stored.  
Some (not all) backends support locking of state.   
Terraform can prevent multiple users run Terraform at the same time. When one user is performing an operation, Terraform locks access for all other users for all operations that can write state. Each terraform run begins with most updated state.  
Benefits:   
* Prevent corruption of state data.   
* Keep sensitive info off local machine. State data is retrieved on demand and only stored in memory.  
* Remote operation of "terraform apply" can take time for large infrastructure. Remote state storage, locking and operation allows local machine shutdown.

#### Workspaces
Each terraform configuration is associated with one backend where persistent data (Terraform state) is stored. Each state is in a workspace. Initial workspace called default. Some backends can have multiple workspaces, i.e. multiple states. Effect is multiple instances of configuration.

#### Bringing existing infrastructure under Terraformâ€™s control involves five main steps:
1. Identify the existing infrastructure to be imported. E.g. docker container.
2. Import the infrastructure into your Terraform state.
3. Write a Terraform configuration that matches that infrastructure.
4. Review the Terraform plan to ensure that the configuration matches the expected state and infrastructure.
5. Apply the configuration to update your Terraform state.
For step 3, can import Terraform state into docker.tf (terraform show -no-color > docker.tf) but must check resources and attributes to merge or remove.
Refer to list of required and optional attributes from provider documentation:

https://registry.terraform.io/providers/kreuzwerker/docker/latest/docs/resources/container#links   

#### IaC best practice: Immutable infrastructure
https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/what-is-mutable-vs-immutable-infrastructure   
 
#### Terraformer
tool to automate some steps associated with importing infrastructure to Terraform.   
generates tf/json + tfstate files from existing infrastructure for all supported objects (reverse Terraform).

#### Automating Infrastructure on Google Cloud with Terraform: Challenge Lab
Topics tested:
- Import existing infrastructure into your Terraform configuration.
- Build and reference your own Terraform modules.
- Add a remote backend to your configuration.
- Use and implement a module from the Terraform Registry.
- Re-provision, destroy, and update infrastructure.
- Test connectivity between the resources you've created.

#### Notes for the challenge lab.
terraform import command: terraform import [options] ADDRESS ID  
ADDRESS refers to a valid resource address.  
Each remote object must be bound to only one resource address. Be careful when you import existing object into Terraform manually. If Terraform creates the object, it guarantees this 1:1 mapping.  
- a resource address is made up of 2 parts: [module path] [resource spec]  
- [module path] is module.module_name[module index]  
- module keyword indicates child (non-root) module.  
- [module index] is optional; for selecting an instance when there are many; includes [] brackets.  
- e.g. module.foo[0].module.bar["a"]  
- [resource spec] is resource_type.resource_name[instance index]  
- e.g. aws_instance.web[3]  
- https://www.terraform.io/cli/state/resource-addressing  
ID refers to the unique resource ID. For example, for VM instances, it is the instance ID.  
For [options], see: https://www.terraform.io/cli/commands/import#example-import-into-module  

#### terraform init command: terraform init [options]
used to initialize working directory containing Terraform configuration files.
re-running already initialized backend will update working directory to use new backend settings.
Use -migrate-state. This option will copy existing state to the new backend.
For configuration with module blocks, re-running init will not change already installed modules. Will only install sources for any new modules added since last init.
Use -upgrade option to update all modules.

#### Modules are reusable configuration files inside a folder.
- Yhey reduce the amount of code needed when there are multiple infrastructure components of the same type. Can use input variables in modules.
- Yop level "provider.tf" is an encapsulated binary file for a single infrastructure or service provider.
- Then, a sub-folder (module) for a component type, e.g. vm instance.
	--  main.tf is configuration file in that module.
	-- example of input variable use in main.tf:
	
variable "instance_name" {} // defining variable. compulsory to provide values in top level provider.tf
variable "instance_zone" {}
variable "instance_type" { // default value given here, so optional to provide value in top level provider.tf. 
  default = "n1-standard-1" //Any value provided in provider.tf will override default.
  }
variable "instance_network" {}

resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
  name         = "${var.instance_name}"
  zone         = "${var.instance_zone}"
  machine_type = "${var.instance_type}"


	-- in top level "provider.tf", provide the values for the input variables:
	
# Create the vm instance 
module "mynet-us-vm" {
  source           = "./instance" //name of module folder. Use ./ for sub-folder within main folder.
  instance_name    = "mynet-us-vm"
  instance_zone    = "us-central1-a"
  instance_network = google_compute_network.mynetwork.self_link
}
